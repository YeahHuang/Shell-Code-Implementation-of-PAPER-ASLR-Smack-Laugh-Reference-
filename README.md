# Shell-Code-Implementation-of-PAPER-ASLR-Smack-Laugh-Reference

This is my shell code(perl) implementation of the paper 《ASLR Smack Laugh Reference》. The papaer was published in 2008, so some of its C code has become not compatible with today's Linux system. I modified the C code to shellcode and made some modifications according to system.

All the code exploited successfully.
